As sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules and small particles that are much smaller than its wavelength (i.e., less than 1/10th the wavelength of visible light). These airborne particles cause short blue-wavelength photons to scatter in different directions more efficiently than other colors because they have a shorter, smaller wavelength which is better suited for this interaction with atmospheric molecules.\n",

This is why even if you are standing under an open sky with no clouds blocking your view, everything around except for very distant mountains will appear blue to some extent.\n",
